# UnityHealth Consumer Application
Melbourne Polytechnic - Capstone Project
## About the project
UnityHealth (UH) is a health information, education & technology consulting company. UH required a ChatBot & a Barcode Scanner feature integrated within their consumer app.
A team of four student developers built this application and implemented the requested features.
- Barcode scanner feature lets users search for products using barcodes.
- Interactions feature lets users view herb, drug, food and supplement interactions.
- AI ChatBot feature resolves customersâ€™ basic & medical queries.

1. *This repository includes code for the user-interface, barcode scanner and interactions functionality only.*

3. *The application uses a free barcode lookup database API, that only provide limited results.*
4. *Authentication tokens for barcode lookup service and IMgateway service have been removed from the source code. New tokens can be acquired by signing up to these services.*
5. *To rectify a technical error with a database, a local database was set up and some API calls will have to be updated.*
